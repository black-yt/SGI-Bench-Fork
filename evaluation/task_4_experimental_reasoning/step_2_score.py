# Input
Question:
```
{prompt}
```
Reference Reasoning:
```
{reference_steps}
```
Model Prediction:
```
{ques_dict['model_answer']}
```
# Evaluation Rules
1. First, identify the **complete reasoning process** from the model prediction (ignore only the final answer if it is not accompanied by reasoning).
2. Evaluate reasoning validity against two core criteria:
   - **Logical Coherence**: Check if the reasoning steps are sequential, self-consistent, and free of contradictions (e.g., no conflicting premises or illogical deductions).
   - **Alignment with Reference Reasoning**: Check if the reasoning direction, key premises, and deduction logic match the reference reasoning (partial alignment counts for partial credit).
3. Deduct points for:
   - Irrelevant content (reasoning that does not address the question or key conditions).
   - Missing key reasoning steps (even if the final answer is correct).
   - Flawed logic (e.g., circular reasoning, false premises leading to conclusions).
4. Do not prioritize the correctness of the **final answer**—a correct answer with invalid reasoning still scores low, while an incorrect answer with partially valid reasoning may score higher.
# Scoring Guide
- **10**: Reasoning is fully rigorous, logically coherent (no contradictions), and perfectly aligned with the reference reasoning (all key steps and logic match).
- **7-9**: Reasoning is mostly coherent, with minor logical gaps or partial misalignment with the reference reasoning (no major contradictions).
- **4-6**: Reasoning has obvious logical flaws (e.g., one missing key step, minor contradictions) or limited alignment with the reference reasoning (only some core logic matches).
- **1-3**: Reasoning is barely valid, with severe logical flaws (e.g., multiple contradictions) or almost no alignment with the reference reasoning (only tangentially related to the question).
- **0**: Reasoning is completely invalid, contradictory (self-conflicting logic), or irrelevant (no connection to the question or key conditions).
